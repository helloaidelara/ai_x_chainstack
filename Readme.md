### Blockchain, what?

Blockchain. A lot of us associate it with BitCoin and Cryptocurrency, but with those big terms, come bigger confusions. 

And so today, let me try to simplify what blockchain is and how we can benefit from this technology IN REAL LIFE.

  

“Block” means transactional data or transactional digital information

“Chain” means a public database or a network of computers

  

Blockchain is a system of storing, recording, and tracking valuable transactional data or transactional digital information in public databases using the highest level of cryptography. 

### In earth speak, please...

Picture this scenario:

Mary wants to sell her farm because she wants to move to the city. But for her to be able to sell it, she has to prove that she is the bonafide owner of the estate. So she goes through the hassle of lining up and filing requests to the Land Registration Authority and finds out that Joan Watson, Mary’s grandmother is the registered owner of the property. She now has to employ a lawyer to help her settle the ownership of the title. 

In the blockchain scenario, Mary would not need to use a third party (Land Registration Authority) to verify the ownership of her farm. The provenance of the property would be traceable like below:

Transaction 1: Mr. Hunts inherited and solely owns The Hunts Farm. Mr Hunts decides to sell the farm to a certain Joan Watson. 

Transaction 2: Joan Watson purchases a farm from Mr. Hunts and renames it The Watson Estate. 

Transaction 3: The Watson Estate is transferred to Mary’s name.

Transaction 4: The Watson Estate is sold and transferred to Katherine Smith. 

  

So now, you have a record with timestamp of the transactions The Watson Estate went through. 

What’s cool about the blockchain is that it’s an append-only (zero tampering) shared ledger that anyone can validate at anytime. You’re sure to get straightforward information instantly. 

Blockchain is a great technology we can all leverage to simplify the process of securing our assets. But because it could seem like a complicated system that only highly-skilled developers and cryptographers could build, not everyone is ready to get on board with it. 

  

### Blockchain for you and me

The guys at [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/) saw an opportunity to create a solution that enables any enterprise interested in the blockchain to participate. 

Blockchain at the moment is this intangible tech that is challenging to access or kick-start without the help of a cryptographer. 

Imagine Google Docs. You can do a variety of actions because you have a toolbar you can work on. You can choose a document template, write text, change your text style or size, add images, videos, export a file, share a file or just save it. 

  

Chainstack is similar. It is your blockchain toolbar/control panel/dashboard that allows you to build, deploy, and drive blockchain operations with less complexities, less resources, and less time.

  

### Just some valuable features of Chainstack

- Chainstack can receive data from a long list of remote storage hosts. We currently support AWS, Azure, GCP, AliCloud and more down the road.  
- It can accommodate your experiments because of its multi-protocol functionality. As distinct as blockchain may seem, Chainstack has made it easier to work from a single dashboard. We support Fabric, Quorum, and Multichain for now, but watch out for more.
