# Chainstack: Your Blockchain Control Center

## Blockchain, what?

Blockchain. A lot of us associate it with BitCoin and Cryptocurrency, but with those big terms, come bigger confusions. 

And so today, let me try to simplify what blockchain is and how we can benefit from this technology IN REAL LIFE.

  

“Block” means transactional data or transactional digital information

“Chain” means a public database or a network of computers 

  

Blockchain is a system of storing, recording, and tracking valuable transactional data or transactional digital information in public databases using the highest level of cryptography. 

  

## In earth speak, please...

Picture this scenario:

Mary wants to sell her farm because she wants to move to the city. But for her to be able to sell it, she has to prove that she is the bonafide owner of the estate. So she goes through the hassle of lining up and filing requests to the Land Registration Authority and finds out that Joan Watson, Mary’s grandmother is the registered owner of the property. She now has to employ a lawyer to help her settle the ownership of the title. 

In the blockchain scenario, Mary would not need to use a third party (Land Registration Authority) to verify the ownership of her farm. The provenance of the property would be traceable through a trail like below:

Transaction 1: Mr. Hunts inherited and solely owns The Hunts Farm. Mr Hunts decides to sell the farm to a certain Joan Watson. 

Transaction 2: Joan Watson purchases a farm from Mr. Hunts and renames it The Watson Estate. 

Transaction 3: The Watson Estate is transferred to Mary’s name.

  
So now, you have a record with timestamps of the transactions for the Watson Estate. 

What’s cool about the blockchain tech is that it’s an append-only (zero tampering) shared ledger that anyone can validate at anytime. You’re sure to get straightforward information instantly. 

Blockchain is a great technology we can all leverage to simplify the process of securing our assets. But because it could seem like a complicated system that only highly-skilled developers and cryptographers could build, not everyone is ready to get on board with it. 

  

## Blockchain for you and me

The guys at [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/) saw an opportunity to create a solution that enables any enterprise interested in the blockchain to participate. 

Blockchain at the moment is this intangible structure that is challenging to access or kick-start without the help of a cryptographer. 

Imagine Google Docs. You can do a variety of actions because you have a toolbar you can work on. You can choose a document template, write text, change your text style or size, add images, videos, export a file, share a file or just save it. 

  
Chainstack is similar. It is your blockchain toolbar/control panel/dashboard that allows you to build, deploy, and drive blockchain operations with less complexities, less resources, and less time.

  

## Some valuable features of Chainstack

- Chainstack can receive data from a long list of remote storage hosts. We currently support Amazon Web Service (AWS), Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AliCloud and more down the road.  
- It can accommodate your experiments because of its multi-protocol functionality. As distinct as blockchain may seem, Chainstack has made it easier to work from a single dashboard. We support blockchain protocols such as Fabric, Quorum, and Multichain for now, but watch out for more.  
- It has a smart and intuitive interface that doesn’t waste your time.  
- A flexible set of instructions (API) is readily available for you to implement on your own.  
- Chainstack is versatile enough to install your blockchain to a variety of environments.  
- Our dashboard is reports-driven. Not a single transaction goes unaccounted for. Detailed entries and logs are conveniently accessible for whatever purpose you may need it for.  
- We’ve made Chainstack a safe and transparent place to work and learn together as a team.

### Set up a project

Click Create a project.  
1. Enter your Project name. A project is your starting point and is used to group multiple blockchain networks related to a defined business process.  
2. Select your Project type. You can toggle between Consortium or Public chain. 
Select Consortium if your project contains one or more permissioned networks. Members invited to a consortium are automatically added to all its networks. Select Public chain if your project has one or more public chain nodes.
3. Add a description for your project.
